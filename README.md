The *Praestes Project* does not believe in the collection of server or user data, for either private or 3rd party usage.
Your privacy and security is the project's top priority. Features are designed to be used as tools for your benefit, not for our gain.
*Praestes* aims to be used for what it's good at. It does not try to be a [Swiss army knife](https://homepage.cs.uri.edu/~thenry/resources/unix_art/ch01s06.html).
If you believe *Praestes* could be a good utility for your server, consider [adding it](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=788206328916738072&scope=bot&permissions=2147483647).
